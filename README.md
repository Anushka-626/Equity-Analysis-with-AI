"#Equity Analysis with AI" 

This research explores how adding sentiment analysis to stock market prediction models
can improve their accuracy. We focused on seven key European stock indices: DE40,
FR40, NL25, IT40, SP35, UK100, and EU50. To capture market sentiment, we used fi-
nancial news and applied sentiment analysis techniques. Our goal was to find out whether
using sentiment data enhances prediction models. The ARIMA model acted as a base-
line to compare the performance of Simple Neural Networks (SimpleNN), both with and
without sentiment indicators. By incorporating sentiment scores with traditional market
data, the SimpleNN model was able to recognize additional trends. We evaluated the
models using key error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error
(MAE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Our findings indi-
cate that sentiment data improves accuracy for some indices, but can also add noise to
others, showing that the impact of sentiment is not uniform across all indices.
